            <p> My name is Philipp Rivadeneira. Coding is something that I like to do and I am hoping to be a full stack
                developer. When I am not coding I love to go skiing in Colorado with my dad. My favorite resort to ski
                in that I
                have been to is Vail because it's almost like being in 3 different resorts at times. They have three
                different
                sides that can be skiied. I am a pretty advanced skiier, so I don't need to turn down any difficult
                slopes at
                this point.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Aside from skiing, I like to watch lots of baseball. My favorite teams to watch are the Royals and
                Twins. Yes,
                I like teams in the same division. But they are very comparable teams and play a similar style over the
                years.
